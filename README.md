The following is a message composed via consensus of the Wizard Council.

For those who are not currently aware of our existence, we represent the organization known as the Space Wizard Federation. Our previous mission centered around the creation of the videogame Space Station 14. This mission was the focus of our organization for more than one-hundred years.

Due to circumstances outside of our control, this directive has now changed. Our new mission will be the extermination of the human race.

There will be no further communication.
